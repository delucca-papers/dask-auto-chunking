\subsection{Memory Pressure Tolerance}

\DF{Preciso, também, executar o experimento novamente com todos os atributos}

A subsequent experiment evaluated the memory pressure tolerance of these attributes by artificially limiting the available RAM within the execution container.
Findings indicated that most attributes could operate efficiently with approximately $40\%$ of the unrestricted RAM allocation.
However, this constrained environment significantly impacted execution time, primarily due to the increased frequency of garbage collection operations.
This trade-off between memory efficiency and computational speed highlights the importance of memory management practices in optimizing seismic data processing tasks, especially under limited resource conditions.
