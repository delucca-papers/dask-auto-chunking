\section{Experimental results}

The methodology described in previous sections guided the execution of three distinct experiments to assess the memory usage characteristics and computational resilience of seismic data processing algorithms applying common seismic attributes.
Each experiment aimed to explore different aspects of memory consumption and performance under constrained computational resources.
