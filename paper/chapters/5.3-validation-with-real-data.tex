\subsection{Validation with Real Data}

\DF{Nesse, eu preciso execute o experimento com outros datasets e pensar em uma forma de detalhar e exibir os resultados}
\DF{Também acho que vale explorar se consigo gerar dados sintéticos que consigam simular o consumo de memória de forma eficiente}

The final phase of experimental evaluation involved validating with real seismic datasets to compare against synthetic data results.
Contrary to expectations, memory usage profiles derived from real data did not align with those observed from synthetic datasets.
This discrepancy indicates that real-world datasets may introduce additional complexities or data characteristics not adequately replicated by synthetic counterparts.
These findings suggest a need for further refinement of synthetic data generation methods to better mimic the intricacies of real seismic data.
