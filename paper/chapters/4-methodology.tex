\section{Methodology}

In developing an effective methodology for analyzing memory consumption in seismic data processing using Python on Linux-based supercomputers, our approach focused on addressing the inherent complexities of Python as a high-level language.
Python's management of memory is not straightforward due to its layered architecture involving memory allocation, garbage collection, and potential interactions with C-based libraries and the operating system's memory management system.
