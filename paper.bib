    abstract = { In this work, we propose a deep learning pipeline for training neural networks that can approximate attributes in three dimensional seismic datasets. Following a supervised learning setting, we use generative adversarial modeling and train specialized networks that learn to translate input amplitude volumes into seismic attributes. Trained networks compute transformations much faster than attributes exact formulation since inference time is highly optimized and rapid in modern GPU architectures. Initial results show that conditional GANs are robust to learn how to compute different attributes with distinct data distributions, without any architecture modification. Via model inference, attribute computations are up to 80x faster than classical formulation.Presentation Date: Monday, October 12, 2020Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Time: 3:05 PMLocation: Poster Station 1Presentation Type: Poster }

    abstract = "{Seismic facies analysis aims to characterize the seismic expression of a reservoir by placing seismic attributes into classes that are presumably related to geologic heterogeneities. Supervised seismic facies analysis can be used to classify the seismic expression of reservoirs in oil field development using well control as the training samples. Manual seismic facies analysis is often subjective, and it is usually time-consuming. Pattern recognition techniques such as support vector machine and neural networks have been used to automate seismic facies analysis. However, they often do not produce satisfactory spatial continuity in their results. The spurious spatial discontinuities are usually caused by the so-called “over-fitting” problem inherent in these methods. To avoid this issue, we have developed a supervised seismic facies analysis method based on image segmentation that promotes spatial continuity of the classified seismic facies. The seed region growing technique borrowed from image segmentation is used to segment attribute maps outward from points of well control. In addition, we calculate the seismic facies probability distribution at every grid point in the seismic image. We use this probability distribution as a weighting coefficient to allow regions to grow anisotropically. As demonstrated by the results on a field data set, this approach improves spatial continuity and indicates promising results.}",

abstract = {Seismic gas reservoirs can be found by identifying anomalies called Direct Hydrocarbon Indicators (DHI). However, in most cases, such anomalies are difficult to detect due to the large amount of data that must be analyzed, requiring a significant amount of time and specialized human resources. In this work, it is proposed a method that uses a Deep Transformer Neural Network to detect the probability of the existence of DHIs in seismic images. Deep Learning has solved problems that require a lot of time and human effort in less time and with greater accuracy. The best results obtained an accuracy of 98\%, a sensitivity of 86\%, and a specificity of 98\%.},
